1. TLS encryption in transit (TLS 1.2 or later)
2. Token value >= 128 bits long, generated by cryptographic compliant random generator 
3. No access and refresh tokens stored in logs and hashed in db
4. Short life of the tokens, based on mutiple factors can be longer or shorter
5. No implicit grant (it's hard to say why use it over authorization code flow with pkce)
6. Client Secret treated as password in terms of complexity and secret in terms of storage and sharing
